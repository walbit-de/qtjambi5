In folder QNativeWidgets:
1) Go into the "cpptest" folder, run qmake and your make tool.
	1.2) check the "bin" folder, there should be an executable testGenerator. Run it.
	
2) Go into the "jambi/scripts" folder. You can see the global.h, the typesystem.xml and a test.pro.
	2.1) Run "ant compile" in order to run the qtjambi generator.
	2.2) See the "QNativeWidgets/jambi/qtjambi/nativewidgets" folder for the generated QNativeWidgetTest.java. 
	2.3) Open it and add the "import com.trolltech.qt.*;" import and remove the leading dot in front of the QWidget extend.

3) Back in the "jambi/scripts" folder. Run "ant compilejava".

Here I tried two approaches:
4a) Run "ant package" 
	4a.1) Switch to the "QNativeWidgets/javatest" folder. Either run the test4a.bat or adapt it to your platform.
	
4b) Run "ant copy"
	4b.1) Switch to the "QNativeWidgets/javatest" folder. Either run the test4b.bat or adapt it to your platform.
	
	
	
4a) yields a long list of exceptions, among them the following:
Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to unpack native libraries, progress so far:

4b) yields the following exception:
