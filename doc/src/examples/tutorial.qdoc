    \title Qt Jambi Tutorial

    This tutorial gives an introduction to GUI programming using the
    Qt Jambi toolkit. It doesn't cover everything; the emphasis is on
    teaching the programming philosophy of GUI programming, and Qt
    Jambi's features are introduced as needed. Some commonly used
    features are never used in this tutorial.

    Chapter one starts with a minimal "Hello world" program and the
    following chapters introduce new concepts.

    The tutorial's source code is located in Qt Jambis's \c
    org/qtjambi/examples/tutorial directory.

    \endlist

    This first program is a simple "Hello world" example. It
    contains only the bare minimum you need to get a Qt Jambi
    application up and running.  The picture below is a screenshot of
    this program.

    \image tutorial1-example.png Screenshot of Chapter 1

    Here's the complete source code for the application:

    \snippet tutorial/HelloWorld.java 0

    \section1 Line by Line Walkthrough


    \snippet tutorial/HelloWorld.java 0

    To use Qt Jambi classes, you need to import at least the \c gui
    package, which includes the QApplication class.  QApplication
    manages various application-wide resources and is needed to run a
    Qt Jambi application. The \c gui package contain GUI related
    classes, such as widgets, which is a user interface object that
    can process user input and draw graphics.

    \snippet tutorial/HelloWorld.java 2

    The \c main() method is the entry point to the program. Almost
    always when using Qt Jambi, \c main() only needs to perform some kind
    of initialization before passing the control to the Qt Jambi library,
    which then tells the program about the user's actions.

    The \c args parameter is the command-line arguments. This is a
    standard Java feature.

    \snippet tutorial/HelloWorld.java 3

    Each Qt Jambi application contains a unique QApplication
    instance, which is a private QApplication class member. To create
    the instance, you call the static \l{QApplication.}{initialize()}
    method with \a args; note that \a args might be changed as Qt
    Jambi removes command-line arguments it recognizes. See
    QApplication.argv() documentation for details.

    The QApplication object must be created before any GUI-related
    features of Qt Jambi are used.

    \snippet tutorial/HelloWorld.java 4

    Here, after the QApplication, comes the first GUI-related code: A
    push button is created.

    QPushButton is a GUI push button that the user can press and
    release. The programmer can change both the overall look and feel
    and many minor properties of it (such as color), as well as the
    widget's content. A QPushButton can show either a text or a QIcon.

    The button is set up to display the text "Hello world!". Because
    we don't specify a parent window (as second argument to the
    QPushButton constructor), the button will be a window of its own,
    with its own window frame and title bar.

    \snippet tutorial/HelloWorld.java 5

    The button is set up to be 120 pixels wide and 40 pixels high
    (excluding the window frame, which is provided by the windowing
    system). We could call QWidget.move() to assign a specific
    screen position to the widget, but instead we let the windowing
    system choose a position.

    \snippet tutorial/HelloWorld.java 6

    The title of the window in which the button is shown is set with
    QWidget.setWindowTitle().

    \snippet tutorial/HelloWorld.java 7

    A widget is never visible when you create it. You must call
    QWidget.show() to make it visible.

    \snippet tutorial/HelloWorld.java 8
    \snippet tutorial/HelloWorld.java 9

    This is where \c main() passes control to Qt Jambi.
    QCoreApplication.exec() will return when the application exits.
    (QCoreApplication is QApplication's base class. It implements
    QApplication's core, non-GUI functionality and can be used when
    developing non-GUI applications.)

    In QCoreApplication.exec(), Qt Jambi receives and processes user and system
    events and passes these on to the appropriate widgets.

    You should now try to compile and run this program.

    The tutorial examples are located in Qt Jambi's \c examples/tutorial directory.
    They are automatically built when you build Qt Jambi.

    If you have typed in the source code manually, you compile and
    run it as a regular Java program (provided that you have set
    up Qt Jambi correctly, see the \l{Installing Qt Jambi}{install
    instructions}).

    \code
        javac org/qtjambi/examples/tutorial/HelloWorld.java
        java org.qtjambi.examples.tutorial.HelloWorld
    \endcode

    \section1 Running the Application

    When you run the application, you will see a small window filled
    with a single button, and on it you can read the famous words:
    "Hello world!"

    \section1 Exercises

    Try to resize the window. Click the button. If you're running
    X11, try running the program with the \c -geometry option (for
    example, \c {-geometry 100x200+10+20}).

    \endlist

    \image tutorial2-example.png Screenshot of Chapter 2

    Having created a window in \l{qtjambi-tutorial1}{Chapter 1,} we will
    now go on to make the application quit properly when the user tells it to.

    We will also use a font that is more exciting than the default
    one. We give the entire source code of the application:

    \snippet tutorial/Quit.java 0

    \section1 Line by Line Walkthrough

    \snippet tutorial/Quit.java 1

    This time, the button says \gui{Quit} and that's exactly what the
    program will do when the user clicks the button.

    \snippet tutorial/Quit.java 2

    We've chosen another size for the button since the text is a bit
    shorter than "Hello world!". We could also have used QFontMetrics
    to set right size, or let QPushButton choose a reasonable
    default.

    \snippet tutorial/Quit.java 3

    Here we choose a new font for the button, an 18-point bold font
    from the Times family. It is also possible to change the default
    font for the entire application, using QApplication::setFont().
    We fetch the value from the Weight enum as the weight of the
    font is given as an int in the constructor.

    \snippet tutorial/Quit.java 4


    We connect the clicked signal to the \c quit() slot in
    QApplication (\l{QApplication.}instance() returns the
    application's unique QApplication instance). \c clicked is an
    instance of the Signal0 class and \c quit() is a regular method in
    QApplication that quits the application. When \c connect() is
    invoked a one-way connection between the two QtJambiObjects is
    established. After the slot is connected to the signal the quit()
    method is invoked when a method on the signal is invoked; this is
    called emitting the signal. In this case, the application will
    exit when the user clicks on the button with the mouse.

    Every Qt Jambi object can have both \c signals (to send
    messages) and \c slots (to receive messages). All widgets are Qt
    Jambi objects, since they inherit QWidget, which indirectly
    inherits QtJambiObject.

    This signal and slot mechanism is perhaps the most central
    feature of Qt Jambi.  The \l{Signals and Slots} documentation
    describes this topic in detail.

    \section1 Running the Application

    When you run this program, you will see an even smaller window than in
    Chapter 1, filled with an even smaller button.

    See \l{tutorial/t1}{Chapter 1} for how to compile and run the application.

    \section1 Exercises

    Try to resize the window. Press the button to close the
    application.

    Are there any other signals in QPushButton you can connect to
    quit? [Hint: The QPushButton inherits most of its functionality
    from QAbstractButton.]

    \endlist

    \image tutorial3-example.png Screenshot of Chapter 3

    This example shows how to create parent and child widgets.

    We'll keep it simple and use just a single parent and a lone child.

    \snippet tutorial/FamilyValues.java 0

    \section1 Line by Line Walkthrough

    \snippet tutorial/FamilyValues.java 1

    Here we simply create a plain widget object. The QWidget class is the
    base class of all user interface objects. The widget is the atom
    of the user interface: It receives mouse, keyboard and other
    events from the window system, and paints a representation of
    itself on the screen. A widget is clipped by its parent and by the
    widgets in front of it.

    A widget that isn't embedded in a parent widget, like this
    particular widget, is called a window. Usually, windows have their
    own window frame and taskbar entry, provided by the window system.
    A widget without a parent widget is always an independent window.
    Its initial position on the screen is controlled by the window
    system.

    \snippet tutorial/FamilyValues.java 2

    We set the window's width to 200 pixels and its height to 120
    pixels.

    \snippet tutorial/FamilyValues.java 3

    A child is born. This QPushButton is created with a parent widget
    \c (window). A child widget is always displayed within its
    parent's area. When displayed, it is clipped by its parent's
    bounds. By default, it is rooted at the top-left corner of its
    parent, at position (0, 0).

    \snippet tutorial/FamilyValues.java 4

    The QWidget.setGeometry() method takes four arguments: The
    first two arguments are the x and y coordinates of the button's
    top-left corner. The coordinates are relative to the parent
    widget. The last two arguments are the button's width and height.
    The result is a button that extends from position (10, 40) to
    position (190, 80).

    \snippet tutorial/FamilyValues.java 5

    When a parent widget is shown, it will call show for all its
    children (except those that were explicitly hidden using
    QWidget.hide()).

    \section1 Running the Application

    The button no longer fills the entire window. Instead, it
    stays at position (10, 40) within the window and with a size
    of (180, 40), because of the QWidget.setGeometry() call.

    \section1 Exercises

    Try resizing the window. How does the button change? What happens
    to the button's height if you run the program with a bigger font?
    What happens if you try to make the window really small?

    This example shows how to create your own widget, and describes
    how to control the minimum and maximum sizes of a widget.

    \snippet tutorial/Widgets.java 1

    \section1 Line by Line Walkthrough

    \snippet tutorial/Widgets.java 0

    Here we create a new class. Because this class inherits from QWidget,
    the new class is a widget and may be a top-level window or a child
    widget (like the QPushButton in the previous chapter).

    \snippet tutorial/Widgets.java 2

    This class has only one member, a constructor (in addition to
    the members it inherits from QWidget). This widget is created
    without a parent. Parentless widgets are top-level windows in Qt
    Jambi, i.e., they are shown in separate windows on the screen.
    You can set a parent in the constructor of QWidget or with the
    QWidget.setParent() method. A widget's parent is also set to the
    widget to which it is added.

    \snippet tutorial/Widgets.java 3

    Because this widget doesn't know how to handle resizing, we fix
    its size. In the next chapter, we will show how a widget can
    respond to resize event from the user.

    \snippet tutorial/Widgets.java 4

    Here we create and set up a child widget of this widget (the new
    widget's parent is \c this, i.e. the \c Widgets instance).

    The \l{QtJambiObject.tr()}{tr()} method call around the string
    literal "Quit" marks the string for translation, making it
    possible to change it at run-time based on the contents of a
    translation file. It is a good habit to use
    \l{QtJambiObject.tr()}{tr()} around all user-visible strings, in case
    you decide later to translate your application to other
    languages.

    The QWidget.setGeometry() call sets both the widget's screen
    position and the size. It is equivalent to calling
    QWidget.move() followed by QWidget.resize(). If we didn't set
    the widgets geometry, the parent widget will position it using
    the buttons \l{QWidget.}{sizeHint()} method - all widgets are
    able to calculate their preferred size.

    \snippet tutorial/Widgets.java 5

    Here we instantiate a Widgets, show it, and execute the
    application.

    \section1 Running the Application

    This program is very similar in behavior to the previous one. The
    difference lies in the way we have implemented it. It does behave
    slightly differently, however. Just try to resize it to see.

    \section1 Exercises

    Try to create another \c Widgets object in \c main(). What happens?

    by using signals and slots, and how to handle resizes.

    \section1 Line by Line Walkthrough

    \snippet tutorial/Blocks.java 1

    \c lcd is a QLCDNumber, a widget that displays numbers in an
    LCD-like fashion. This instance is set up to display two digits.
    We set the \l QLCDNumber.segmentStyle property to \l
    QLCDNumber.SegmentStyle.Filled to make the LCDs more readable.

    \snippet tutorial/Blocks.java 2
    \snippet tutorial/Blocks.java 3
    \snippet tutorial/Blocks.java 4

    The user can use the QSlider widget to adjust an integer value in
    a range. Here we create a horizontal one, set its minimum value
    to 0, its maximum value to 99, and its initial value to 0.

    \snippet tutorial/Blocks.java 5

    Here we use the \l{signals and slots} mechanism to connect the
    slider's \l{QSlider.}{valueChanged} signal to the LCD number's
    \l{QLCDNumber.}{display()} slot.

    Whenever the slider's value changes it broadcasts the new
    value by emitting the \l{QSlider.}{valueChanged} signal. Because
    that signal is connected to the LCD number's
    \l{QLCDNumber.}{display()} slot, the slot is called when the
    signal is broadcast. Neither of the objects knows about the other.
    This is essential in component programming.

    Slots are otherwise normal Java member methods and follow the
    normal Java access rules.

    \snippet tutorial/Blocks.java 6
    \snippet tutorial/Blocks.java 7

    \c Blocks uses a QVBoxLayout to manage the geometry of its child widgets. For
    that reason, we don't need to specify the screen coordinates for each widget
    like we did in Chapter 4. In addition, using a layout ensures that the child
    widgets are resized when the window is resized. Then we add the \c quit, \c lcd
    and \c slider widgets to the layout using QBoxLayout.addWidget().

    The QWidget.setLayout() method installs the layout on \c
    Blocks. The call to \l{QWidget.}{setLayout()} automatically sets
    the parent of the widgets in the layout so that they are children
    of \c Blocks. Because of this, we didn't need to specify \c this
    as the parent for the \c quit, \c lcd and \c slider widgets.

    In Qt Jambi, widgets are either children of other widgets
    (e.g. \c this), or they have no parent. A widget can be \e added
    to a layout, in which case the layout becomes responsible for
    managing the geometry of that widget, but the layout can never act
    as a parent itself. Indeed, QWidget's constructor takes a QWidget
    pointer for the parent, and QLayout doesn't inherit from QWidget.

    \section1 Running the Application

    The LCD number reflects everything you do to the slider, and the
    widget handles resizing well. Notice that the LCD number widget
    changes in size when the window is resized (because it can), but the
    others stay about the same (because otherwise they would look strange).

    \section1 Exercises

    Try changing the LCD number to add more digits or to change mode
    (QLCDNumber.setMode()). You can even add four push buttons to
    set the number base.

    You can also change the slider's range.

    Perhaps it would have been better to use a QSpinBox than a slider?

    Try to make the application quit when the LCD number overflows.

    The \c LCDRange widget is a widget without any API. It just has a
    constructor. This sort of widget is not very useful, so we'll add
    some API later.

    \snippet tutorial/BlocksGalore.java 6

    The code in the constructor is lifted straight from the \c Blocks
    constructor in Chapter 5. The only differences are that the
    \gui{Quit} button is left out and the class is renamed.


    The \c BlocksGalore class, too, contains no API except a constructor:

    \snippet tutorial/BlocksGalore.java 0

    The push button that used to be in what is now \c LCDRange has been
    separated so that we can have one \gui{Quit} button and many \c LCDRange
    objects.

    \snippet tutorial/BlocksGalore.java 2

    We create a QWidget with a QGridLayout that will contain three
    columns.  The QGridLayout automatically arranges its widgets in
    rows and columns; you can specify the row and column numbers when
    adding widgets to the layout, and QGridLayout will fit them into
    the grid.

    We use a QVBoxLayout to lay out the \gui Quit button and the grid
    layout. The QWidget.addLayout() method is similar to the
    QWidget.addWidget() method, making the given layout a child of the
    main layout.

    We then proceed to create the LCDRange widgets:

    \snippet tutorial/BlocksGalore.java 3
    \snippet tutorial/BlocksGalore.java 4

    We create nine \c LCDRange widgets, and we arrange them in
    three rows and three columns. We set the parent of the widgets to
    the BlocksGalore instance in the constructor. If we didn't, the parent
    of the widgets would be set when the layout is installed on the
    widget with \l{QWidget.}{setLayout()}. For this reason, it
    might be a good idea to always set a parent to a widget in its
    constructor.

    That's all, folks!

    \section1 Running the Application

    This program shows how easy it is to use many widgets at a
    time. Each one behaves like the slider and LCD number in the
    previous chapter. Again, the difference lies in the
    implementation.

    This example shows how to create custom widgets with signals and
    slots, and how to connect them together in more complex ways.

    \section1 Line by Line Walkthrough

    This file is mainly lifted from \c BlocksGalore in Chapter 6; only
    the non-trivial changes are noted here.


    The LCDRange class now includes three members besides the
    constructor. They make up an interface between this widget and
    other components in a program. Until now, \c LCDRange didn't
    really have an API at all. We will examine them as we stumble
    upon them in the code.


    This class is for the most part equal to LCDRange from chapter
    6, and only the changes are noted here.

    \snippet tutorial/ConnectedSliders.java 0

    We have added a private variable that will hold the number in
    the display.

    \snippet tutorial/ConnectedSliders.java 6

    Here we declare our first custom signal: \c valueChanged. We will emit it
    whenever the value of the LCD changes. A signal is an instance of one of the
    signal classes, which are Signal1, Signal2 ...  Signal9). The suffix number is
    equal to the number of arguments of the signal; the types of the arguments must
    be given as class generics. We want one argument (the value of the LCD
    display), so we use the Signal1 class with Integers. You already know how to
    connect to the signal. The signal can be connected to any method that takes an
    Integer.

    We move on to the constructor:

    \snippet tutorial/ConnectedSliders.java 7
    \snippet tutorial/ConnectedSliders.java 8
    \dots 12
    \snippet tutorial/ConnectedSliders.java 9
    \snippet tutorial/ConnectedSliders.java 10
    \dots 12
    \snippet tutorial/ConnectedSliders.java 11

    We connect the sliders \c valueChanged signal to our \c display()
    slot, and to our own \c valueChanged signal. The signal you
    connect will be triggered by the signal to which it is connected.

    Let's take a closer look at what happens when the user operates
    the slider. The slider sees that its value has changed and emits
    the QSlider.valueChanged signal. That signal is connected both to
    the QLCDNumber.display() slot and to the \c valueChanged signal of
    the \c LCDRange.

    Thus, when the signal is emitted, \c LCDRange emits its own \c
    valueChanged signal. In addition, QLCDNumber.display() is called
    and shows the new number.

    Note that you're not guaranteed any particular order of execution;
    \c LCDRange.valueChanged may be emitted before or after
    QLCDNumber.display() is called.

    \snippet tutorial/ConnectedSliders.java 12

    The implementation of \c value() is straightforward. It simply
    returns the slider's value.

    \snippet tutorial/ConnectedSliders.java 13

    The implementation of \c setValue() is equally straightforward.
    Note that because the slider and LCD number are connected,
    setting the slider's value automatically updates the LCD number
    as well. In addition, the slider will automatically adjust the
    value if it is outside its legal range.

    The \c ConnectedSlider class is copied from BlocksGalore in the previous
    chapter except for the constructor. We examine the changes here:


    \snippet tutorial/ConnectedSliders.java 1

    When we create the nine \c LCDRange objects, we connect them using
    the \l{signals and slots} mechanism. Each has its \c
    valueChanged signal connected to the previous one's \c

    signal when its value changes, we are here creating a chain of
    signals and slots.
