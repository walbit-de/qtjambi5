    The Star Delegate example shows how to create a delegate that
    can paint itself and that supports edition.

    When displaying data in a QListView, QTableView, or QTreeView,
    the individual items are drawn by a \l{Delegate
    Classes}{delegate}. Also, when the user starts editing an item
    (e.g., by double-clicking the item), the delegate provides an
    editor widget that is placed on top of the item while editing
    takes place.

    Delegates are subclasses of QAbstractItemDelegate. Qt Jambi
    provides QItemDelegate, which inherits QAbstractItemDelegate and
    handles the most common data types (notably \c Integer and
    String). If we need to support custom data types, or want to
    customize the rendering or the editing for existing data types, we
    can subclass QAbstractItemDelegate or QItemDelegate. See
    \l{Delegate Classes} for more information about delegates, and
    \l{Model/View Programming} if you need a high-level introduction
    to Qt Jambi's model/view architecture (including delegates).

    In this example, we will see how to implement a custom
    delegate to render and edit a "star rating" data type, which can
    stores values such as "1 out of 5 stars".

    The example consists of the following classes:

    \list
    \o \c StarRating is the custom data type. It stores a rating
       expressed as stars, such as "2 out of 5 stars" or "5 out of
       6 stars".

    \o \c StarDelegate inherits QItemDelegate and provides support
       for \c StarRating (in addition to the data types already
       handled by QItemDelegate).

    \o \c StarEditor inherits QWidget and is used by \c StarDelegate
       to let the user edit a star rating using the mouse.

    \o \c StarWindow fills a QTableWidget with some data and
      installs the delegate on it.
    \endlist

    \section1 StarDelegate Class Implementation


    The StarDelegate consists of public methods reimplemented
    from QItemDelegate to provide custom rendering and editing.

    We provide the class with a constructor that takes a QWidget,
    which we use for instantiating the superclass. The native Qt code
    demands that all objects that inherit QObject has a parent;
    otherwise the program will fail.

    The \l{QAbstractItemDelegate.}{paint()} method is
    reimplemented from QItemDelegate and is called whenever the view
    needs to repaint an item:

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 2

    The method is invoked once for each item, represented by a
    QModelIndex object from the model. If the data stored in the item
    is a \c StarRating, we paint it ourselves; otherwise, we let
    QItemDelegate paint it for us. This ensures that the \c
    StarDelegate can handle the most common data types.

    In the case where the item is a \c StarRating, we draw the
    background if the item is selected, and we draw the item using \c
    StarRating.paint(), which we will review later.

    Any kind of Object can be stored in a model, but when the item
    delegate encounters items it does not know how to paint, it will
    leave the view for that item empty.

    The \l{QAbstractItemDelegate.}{createEditor()} method is
    called when the user starts editing an item:

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 4

    If the item is a \c StarRating, we create a \c StarEditor. The
    editor must have the \a parent; if not, it would be displayed as a
    top-level window.

    The \l{QAbstractItemDelegate.}{setEditorData()} method is
    called when an editor is created to initialize it with data from
    the model:

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 5

    We simply call \c setStarRating() on the editor.

    The \l{QAbstractItemDelegate.}{setModelData()} method is
    called when editing is finished, to commit data from the editor to
    the model:

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 6

    The editing is finished when the user clicks on the editor.
    Since we propagate the mouse click event (i.e., do not accept it),
    the view will close the editor for us when it receives the
    QMouseEvent.

    The \c sizeHint() method returns an item's preferred size:

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 3

    We simply forward the call to \c StarRating.

    \section1 StarEditor Class Implementation

    The \c StarEditor is used by \c StarDelegate to edit items.
    The user edits a \c StarRating by moving the mouse over the
    editor. When the editing is finished the value of the star rating
    can be retrieved with \c getRating().

    The protected methods are reimplemented from QWidget to
    handle mouse and paint events. The private method \c
    starAtPosition() is a helper method that returns the number of
    the star under the mouse pointer.

    Let's start with the constructor:

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 7

    We enable \l{QWidget.setMouseTracking()}{mouse tracking} on
    the widget so we can follow the cursor even when the user doesn't
    hold down any mouse button. We also turn on QWidget's
    \l{QWidget.autoFillBackground}{auto-fill background} feature to
    obtain an opaque background. (Without the call, the view's
    background would shine through the editor.)

    The \l{QWidget.}{paintEvent()} method is reimplemented from
    QWidget:

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 8

    We simply call \c StarRating.paint() to draw the stars, just
    like we did when implementing \c StarDelegate.

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 9

    In the mouse event handler, we call \c setRating() on the
    private data member \c starCount to reflect the current cursor
    position, and we call QWidget.update() to force a repaint.

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 10

    The \c starAtPosition() method uses basic linear algebra to
    find out which star is under the cursor.

    \section1 StarRating Class Implementation

    The \c StarRating class represents a rating as a number of
    stars.  In addition to holding the data, it is also capable of
    painting the stars on a QPaintDevice, which in this example is
    either a view or an editor. The \c starCount member variable
    stores the current rating, and \c maxStarCount stores the highest
    possible rating (typically 5). The polygons used for drawing stars
    and diamonds are set up in a static block.

    The constructor initializes \c starCount and \c maxStarCount:

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 11

    The \c paint() method paints the stars in this \c StarRating
    object on a paint device:

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 12

    We first set the pen and brush we will use for painting. The
    \c mode parameter can be either \c ReadWrite or \c ReadOnly. If \c
    mode is read and write, we use the \l{QPalette.}{Highlight} color
    instead of the \l{QPalette.}{Foreground} color to draw the stars.

    Then we draw the stars. If we are in \c ReadWrite mode, we
    paint diamonds in place of stars if the rating is less than the
    highest rating.

    The \c sizeHint() method returns the preferred size for an area
    to paint the stars on:

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 3

    The preferred size is just enough to paint the maximum number of
    stars. The method is called by both \c StarDelegate.sizeHint()
    and \c StarEditor.sizeHint().

    \section1 StarWindow Class Implementation

    StarWindow inherits QWidget and displays a table that has a
    star delegate installed.

    The table is set up in the \c createTable() method:

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 0

    The \c createTable() method creates a QTableWidget and sets
    a \c StarDelegate on it. We set

    \dots

    \snippet StarDelegate.java 1

    The rest of the method fills the table with data including
    star ratings. \l{QAbstractItemView.}{DoubleClicked} and
    \l{QAbstractItemView.}{SelectedClicked} are set as
    \l{QAbstractItemView.editTriggers()}{edit triggers}, so that the
    editor is opened by a single click when the star rating item is
    selected.

    \section1 Possible Extensions and Suggestions

    There are many ways to customize Qt Jambi's \l{Model/View
    Programming}{model/view framework}. The approach used in this
    example is appropriate for most custom delegates and editors.
    Examples of possibilities not used by the star delegate and star
    editor are:

    \list
    \o It is possible to open editors programmatically by calling
       QAbstractItemView.edit(), instead of relying on edit
       triggers. This could be use to support other edit triggers
       than those offered by QAbstractItemView.
       For example, in the Star Delegate example, hovering over an
       item with the mouse might make sense as a way to pop up an
       editor.

    \o By reimplementing QAbstractItemDelegate.editorEvent(), it is
       possible to implement the editor directly in the delegate,
       instead of creating a separate QWidget subclass.
