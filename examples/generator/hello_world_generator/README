Simple Hello World example

NOTE: Text below is outdated, instead please write us proper text...

This is a simple hello world example to show the most basic use of the qtjambi generator.
The example shows how to transfer a Qt C++ Widget including some classes to a it's
java equivalents.

Prerequisites:
You must compile QtJambi from source to be able to run this example. This is done issuing
ant on the root directory of your source installation.

1)
You must edit build.properties with the location of the toplevel directory
if the QtJambi build tree.

2)
You must edit build.properties with qtjambi.config to match the value from
the same setting in the QtJambi build tree.

3)
You must edit org_qtjambi_test/org_qtjambi_test.pro to set the value of

CONFIG += debug

to match that of ${qtjambi.config} in point 2) above.

4)
Ensure your shell environment it setup for build Qt C++, like ensuring
qmake and the compiler are in the $PATH.

5)
This step is not needed for the out-the-box case of building the main
project at ../../.. and then building this.  However see the setting

<generator ... generatorExe="${generator.exe.abspath}" ... />

You can provide ab absolute path with -Dgenerator.exe.abspath=/tmp/generator
argument to ANT.

Alternativly setup $PATH as below.

Ensure your shell environment it setup to include the generator binary from
the QtJambi build from source.  This maybe generator/generator on Unix
system and generator\release\generator.exe in Windows systems.

For example:
export PATH=$PATH:$JAMBIDIR/generator
or
set PATH=%PATH%;%JAMBIDIR%\generator\release



Stages:

1) Have a look in the directory src. Here you will find the C++ sources of the widget. It
is possible to create a binary out of these sources issuing qmake and make in the directory
makefiles. The binary will end up in a new directory bin.

2) Now, in the jambi sub directory you will find a directory structure suitable for building
a qtjambi widget. The scripts directory contains the generator build files (build.xml,
pro file, typesystem file and an include file global.h). In this directory you can issue the
command "ant" to start the build. This should produce a file
test-<platform>-<compiler>-<qt-version>.jar

3) In the java directory you will find a TestJava.java. It corresponds mainly to src/main.cpp.
If you adjust the testit.sh with the correct name of qtjambi.jar and test.jar, and rework it
to a bat file if you are working on Windows, you should be able to compile and launch the
java version of the widget.

The class is now built and included by default inside the generated JAR, so
it can be run almost right away with:


I did not need the native JAR at $QTJAMBI/build/qtjambi-*.jar because this
example repackages the native parts into test-<platform>-<compiler>-<qt-version>.jar

You may need "-debug" in the name of $QTJAMBI/qtjambi-4.7.4.jar if you are
building in debug mode.


On Linux 64bit the command line looked like this:

java -cp $QTJAMBI/qtjambi-4.7.4.jar:test-linux64-gcc-4.7.4.jar test.TestJava

More generally:

java -cp $QTJAMBI/qtjambi-<qt-version>.jar:test-<platform>-<compiler>-<qt-version>.jar test.TestJava

Expand the above wildcards manually before executing the command.


If there are problems loading the implementation library (such as the error below) try:

Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /tmp/QtJambi_userid_amd64_4.7.4_genex-gcc-YYYYMMDD-HHMM/lib/liborg_qtjambi_test_debuglib.so.1: libtestGenImpl_debuglib.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

on windows =>  add build/platform-output*/lib directory to %PATH%
on Linux   =>  add build/platform-output*/lib directory to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
on MacOSX  =>  add build/platform-output*/lib directory to $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
