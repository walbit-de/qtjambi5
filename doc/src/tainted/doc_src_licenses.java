                    The "Artistic License"

                                    Preamble

    The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
    Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
    semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
    while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
    the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
    reasonable modifications.

    Definitions:

            "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
            Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
            created through textual modification.

            "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
            modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
            of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

            "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
            copyrights for the package.

            "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
            this Package.

            "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
            basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
            and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
            Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
            as a market that must bear the fee.)

            "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
            itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
            It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
            under the same conditions they received it.

    1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
    Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
    duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

    2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
    derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
    modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

    3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
    that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
    when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
    following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

    4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
    executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

    5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
    Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
    Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
    you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
    commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
    distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
    product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
    an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
    form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
    interpreter is so embedded.

    6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
    output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
    under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
    them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
    Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
    Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
    binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
    neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
    fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
    not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
    Package.

    7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
    languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
    emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
    Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
    equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
    not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
    regression tests for the language.

    8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
    permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
    when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
    to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
    construed as a distribution of this Package.

    9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
    products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

    10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

    the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make

    Definitions:

            "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
            Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
            created through textual modification.

            "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been

    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

    4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
    executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

    5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
    Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
    Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
    you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
    commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
    distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
    product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
    an executable of yours (by linking); this shall berued as a mere
    form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
    interpreter is so embedded.

    6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
    output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
    under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
    them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
    Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
    Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
    binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
    neither berued as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
    fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
    not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
    Package.

    7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
    languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
    emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
    Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
    equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
    not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
    regression tests for the language.

    8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
    permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
    when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
    to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
   rued as a distribution of this Package.

    9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
    products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

    10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
