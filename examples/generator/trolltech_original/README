The generator example is an example that illustrates how to make use
of the Qt Jambi Generator

Before you start compiling the example, you will need to set the JAMBIDIR
environment variable to the root of your JAMBI installation. Also include
$JAMBIDIR/generator in your path.

To compile the generator example, simply run 'ant' on the
'build.xml' file in the generator directory. This will
create a custom platform .jar file which includes the native libraries
which should be used when deploying the generator example application.

To launch the example, simply issue 

java -jar qtjambi-generator-example-<platform>-<qt-version>.jar
