TODO: file layout. It needs to be redone, too.

Control variables for Ant tasks
---

Most of them are still inconsistent with new system, but they will be changed 
as they are checked whether they are still used and useful.

There is several namespaces, which provides easy lookup about where certain variables falls in:
 qtjambi: namespace which contains all variables actually used in ant tasks.
  Subnamespaces described below is used for further convention.
 qt: namespace for data directly related to Qt
 phonon: namespace which can be used to specify data for phonon. There is two phonon versions,
  Qt and KDE phonon, the latter may not use same paths Qt libraries uses.

For example, qtjambi.qt.libdir is a path used in ant tasks to find Qt libraries. qt.libdir, found
in buildpath.properties, specifies preset path which may been overridden by path calculated
from QTDIR environment variable.
