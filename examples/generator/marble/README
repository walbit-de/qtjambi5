The Marble widget

This example shows how to compile/test a jambi version of the marble widget. This example
have only been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 10.04). It should be possible to adapt to windows
as well.

Prerequisites:

1. Install ant 1.7 (1.8 support soon to come) and Java JDK. OpenJDK and Sun JDK
should work equally well. Be sure to have JAVA_HOME set in your
environment, together with PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH. This is necessary to be able
to build Jambi.

2. Build Qt and Qt Jambi
You must have a development version of Qt available. On Linux, we are working on a
setup which allows you to compile against system Qt (development version), but at the
time of writing, you have to brew your own using the description found here:
http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-jambi/pages/BuildingFromGit. Set your QTDIR and modify your
path as described in the bottom of this wiki page. PS: Be sure to have QtDbus support
in your Qt configure! 
 
3. Build marble
A description on how to do this can be found on http://edu.kde.org/marble/obtain.php
When you install marble (make install), it default ends up in /usr/local. On my Ubuntu system, apps seem
to pick up shared libraries that resides in /usr/local/lib, on other systems you may
have to modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or similar.

4. Modify some paths
Set JAMBIDIR=<root path of your jambi installation> and PATH=$JAMBIDIR/generator:$PATH. Then set
MARBLEDIR=<root path of your marble installation>.

Build:

Now, all you should have to do is to run ant in the "scripts" directory! This will produce
c++ and java stub files for qtjambi libraries, compile them and bundle them all together
in a jar file which should end up in the directory "target".

Test:

You should now be able to run the testit.sh program found in the java directory. Just replace
the version/os/compiler in the classpath loading so that they match the actual jar files 
produced in the steps earlier. It should bring up the famous marble widget with the globe
if everything is setup correctly (and working). Enjoy! I hope for many feedbacks on the
#marble IRC channel!
